I'm **Pau**, interested in theoretical physics, maths, science communication and computer science. I graduated **Physics** at [University of Murcia](https://www.um.es), Spain and I'm currently enrolled at the Master in Advanced Physics at [University of Valencia](https://www.uv.es). Here, one can find (possibly cool?) stuff I've made. If interested, feel free to look at my CV and/or contact me.

My interests within physics are **gravitation**, **gauge theories** and **mathematical physics**. I also enjoy science communication, not only in theoretical stuff but also about cheap, easy-to-do science experiments to bring people closer to science.

Outside of physics, I like mathematics, have dabbled with cybersecurity and computer science. I also like music, films and spending time with my friends :).
